# RadiationCalculator
**Simple script for the calculus of the** ***radiation heat***.


## Content  
In this repository you can find an offline calculator for heat irradiatied by the solid.

In this repository you can find a simple Python code and a .exe file that read

1 Temperature [Kelvin]

2 [Emissivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity)   
 - If the emissivity is unknown, it estimated it through the quality of the surface treatment



from the terminal and write:

1 The heat irradiated by the solid [W/m^2]

## Theory

The formula is qradiation=bolzconsta x emissivity x temperature^4

based on [Law of Stefan-Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law)

## Explanation ready - Support

To run the script, simply write python Radiation.py.

If you are working in Windows, simply double click on the exe file.

The code is written in a very simple way, in order to be easily understood, but if you need other explanation, feel free to contact me:
